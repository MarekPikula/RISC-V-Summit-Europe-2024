    <h3 class='sectionHead' id='introduction'><a id='x1-1000'></a>Introduction</h3>
<!-- l. 87 --><p class='noindent'>RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) is making its way
      towards mainstream use. It opens up exciting avenues
      for software vectorization on RISC-V, promising
      improved performance and power efficiency across
      various computational tasks ranging from image
      processing to AI workloads. However, realizing its full
      potential demands careful evaluation and optimization of
      software implementations. This article delves into the
      nuances of accelerating software development for
      new ISA extensions, with a spotlight on the RVV
      extension.
    </p><!-- l. 95 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='approaches-to-vectorization'><a id='x1-2000'></a>Approaches to Vectorization</h4>
<!-- l. 97 --><p class='noindent'>One of the key challenges in the software RVV
      vectorization is assessing the performance difference
      between different algorithmic approaches. Since the
      ratification in 2021, RVV support has gradually come to the upstream toolchains. Although the development
      progress of auto-vectorizers in both GCC and LLVM is
      promising, some use cases will always require a manual
      approach. Unfortunately, not many reliable sources give
      a “golden standard” guide to follow. Two notable
      exceptions are RVVRadar[<a id='x1-2001'></a><a href='#cite.0_KSG_2022'>1</a>] and RVV benchmark from
      Camel Coder[<a id='x1-2002'></a><a href='#cite.0_CC_2024'>2</a>], but both require physical hardware or
      manual performance calculations.
    </p><!-- l. 107 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='initial-hardware-constraints'><a id='x1-3000'></a>Initial Hardware Constraints</h4>
  <!-- l. 109 --><p class='noindent'>At the outset of any project involving emerging ISA
      extensions like RVV, there is often a lack of readily
      available hardware for testing and validation. While
      tools like QEMU provide means to check the validity
      of the algorithms, they may not accurately reflect
      performance characteristics. When comparing scalar
      and RVV implementations of the same algorithm,
      the recently released QEMU 8.2 performs worse
      on the latter. This can lead to suboptimal design
      choices based on incomplete or inaccurate performance
      assessments.


    </p><!-- l. 117 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='role-of-simulation-tools'><a id='x1-4000'></a>Role of Simulation Tools</h4>
<!-- l. 119 --><p class='noindent'>Simulation tools play a crucial role in software
      development for emerging ISA extensions. While the
      Spike ISA simulator offers robust tracing and debugging
      functionality, it lacks in the area of microarchitectural
      considerations, which are particularly important for such
      a large and complex ISA extension like RVV.
    </p><!-- l. 124 --><p class='indent'>  Software HDL simulation tools provide detailed profiling
      capabilities but suffer from slow performance, especially
      for complex designs. Classical FPGA prototyping offers a
      middle ground but comes with high initial costs and
      limited tracing capabilities.
    </p><!-- l. 129 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h3 class='sectionHead' id='firesim-simulation'><a id='x1-5000'></a>FireSim Simulation</h3>
<!-- l. 131 --><p class='noindent'>To address these challenges, FireSim[<a id='x1-5001'></a><a href='#cite.0_ISCA-50'>3</a>] offers a
      comprehensive solution. FireSim extends the ChipYard[<a id='x1-5002'></a><a href='#cite.0_chipyard'>4</a>]
      project with advanced software and hardware simulation
      capabilities, making it an ideal platform for developing
      and testing RISC-V core implementations, along with
      external or internal specialized accelerators.
    </p><!-- l. 137 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='key-features'><a id='x1-6000'></a>Key Features</h4>
<!-- l. 139 --><p class='noindent'>FireSim provides several key features tailored to software
      development for emerging ISA extensions:
    </p>
    <ul class='itemize1'>
      <li class='itemize'>Ready-to-use  processor  and  accelerator  cores
        with pre-built <span class='ecti-1000'>FireMarshal </span>Linux environment.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'><span class='ecti-1000'>TracerV </span>: In-hardware tracing with out-of-band
        Flame Graph visualization.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>Support for automatic ILA insertion, assertion
        synthesis, and out-of-band performance counters.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>Multicore   and   multi-SoC   setups   (so-called
        <span class='ecti-1000'>supernode   </span>simulation)  with  on-chip  network
        connected  to  the  host  for  complex  workload
        scenarios.</li></ul>
                                                 <!-- l. 154 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='cloud-deployment'><a id='x1-7000'></a>Cloud Deployment</h4>
   <!-- l. 156 --><p class='noindent'>One of the notable advantages of FireSim is its support
      for cloud deployment, specifically on AWS EC2 F1
      instances with Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA cards.
      This approach offers a low entry barrier on both
      technical and financial levels, allowing teams to provision
      FPGA resources quickly and pay only for the compute
      time used. It also significantly decreases the risk of the
      entire operation. There is no need to buy expensive
      FPGA hardware or license Vivado, as everything comes
      in a pay-by-hour manner, which is especially important
      for software-focused teams.
    </p><!-- l. 165 --><p class='indent'>   This approach might also appeal to multidisciplinary,
      remote teams. For example, the hardware team can
      develop an SoC on local hardware they already have
      on-site (FireSim also supports local targets) and
      immediately pass the work to a remote software team.
      Overall, this can dramatically increase the speed of
      evaluation and integration and allow for more dynamic,
      end-to-end product development.
    </p><!-- l. 171 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h3 class='sectionHead' id='rvv-case-study'><a id='x1-8000'></a>RVV Case Study</h3>
   <!-- l. 173 --><p class='noindent'>We utilized FireSim to develop and optimize the RVV port for the
      <span class='ecti-1000'>pixman</span><span class='footnote-mark'><a href='abstract2.html#fn1x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8001f1'></a>
      project. First, we evaluated readily available RVV-capable
      cores. We started with the <span class='ecti-1000'>Tenstorrent Ocelot</span>[<a id='x1-8003'></a><a href='#cite.0_ocelot'>5</a>] project
      (a RISCV-BOOM core with integrated RVV accelerator),
      which already had ChipYard integration. Unfortunately,
      the implementation was not directly synthesizable in
      the FireSim setting. The second choice was <span class='ecti-1000'>PULP
        Ara</span>[<a id='x1-8004'></a><a href='#cite.0_Ara2020'>6</a>], a coprocessor for the CORE-V CVA6 core.
      We smoothly adapted the existing ChipYard CVA6
      wrapper and successfully built and simulated the SoC
      on AWS node, running a provided Fedora image
      by following the comprehensive and, importantly,
      complete documentation of the aforementioned projects,
      even though we had no prior experience with AWS
      tools.
    </p>
    <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='development-process'><a id='x1-9000'></a>Development Process</h4>
   <!-- l. 188 --><p class='noindent'>In the initial phase of the pixman vectorization, we
      focused on the correctness of the approach and not on
      performance. For this we used QEMU environment,
      because, even with its suboptimal RVV implementation,


      it greatly outperforms any other emulation solution.
      Another important benefit is the possibility of working
      on a local machine without the need to provision AWS
      resources.
    </p><!-- l. 194 --><p class='indent'>  Once we worked out the general solution, we started
      profiling the code in the FireSim environment. This way, we
      could reliably compare between different optimizations
      and with the base scalar implementation. To do this, we
      used detailed TracerV reports along with performance
      counter measurements. We also experimented with
      different microarchitectural configurations to see the
      implications for overall performance, which allowed us
      to make informed decisions regarding algorithmic
      approaches – optimal in both low- and high-end
      configurations.
    </p><!-- l. 203 --><p class='noindent'>
    </p>
    <h3 class='sectionHead' id='conclusions'><a id='x1-10000'></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!-- l. 205 --><p class='noindent'>Our experience with FireSim demonstrates the potential
      of the cloud-based FPGA simulation for accelerating
      software development for emerging ISA extensions like
      RVV. By providing access to cost-effective, scalable
      hardware resources and comprehensive simulation
      capabilities, FireSim enables faster iteration cycles and
      more informed design decisions. This approach not only
      benefits individual developers but also facilitates
      collaboration in remote teams, bridging the gap between
      hardware and software development efforts.
